		<p>Junji Ito is a Japanese horror mangaka.</p>
		<p>Some of his most notable works include Tomie, a series chronicling an immortal girl who drives her stricken admirers to madness,</p>
		<p>Uzumaki, a three-volume series about a town obsessed with spirals, and Gyo, a two-volume story where fish are controlled by a strain of sentient bacteria called "the death stench."</p>
		<p>His other works are Itou Junji Kyoufu Manga Collection, a collection of different short stories including a series of stories named Souichi's Journal of Delights,
		and Junji Ito's Cat Diary: Yon & Mu, a self-parody about him and his wife living in a house with two cats.</p>
		<p>In addition to Kazuo Umezu, Itō has cited Hideshi Hino, Shinichi Koga, Yasutaka Tsutsui, and H. P. Lovecraft as being major influences on his work.</p>
		<p>The universe Itō depicts is cruel and capricious; his characters often find themselves victims of malevolent unnatural circumstances for no discernible reason or punished out of proportion for minor infractions against an unknown and incomprehensible natural order.</p>
		<p>Some of the recurring themes of Itō's work include jealousy, envy, body horror, seemingly ordinary characters who begin to act out of irrational compulsion, the breakdown of society, deep-sea organisms, and the inevitability of one's demise, all displayed through a realistic and simple design, which emphasizes the contrast between beauty and death. 
			The events narrated are unpredictable and violent, and arise from normal situations.</p>
